# XCat Data Science Hackathon Internship 


• Got the 2nd best place out of 12 groups by myself in the Data Science Hackathon where almost all participants except for me were graduate students.

• Analyzed the cause of telework on the productivity (evaluation) of the workers by using both DID and Synthetic Control Method (SCM) with R (synth ) and Python

• Presented the result of the causal inference research by using data visualization with matplotlib

• Suggested the A/B test with stratified randomization method as a new function in the working administration system from the consequence of the above causal inference analysis to make the future analysis more credible
